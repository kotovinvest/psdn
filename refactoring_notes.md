## Refactoring Notes for psdn Repository

### Issues Identified:

1.  **Redundant Logging:** `main.py` implements a custom logging configuration that is already handled more effectively by the `modules/logger.py` module. This creates unnecessary code duplication and inconsistency.

2.  **Unused/Empty Files:** The following files are either empty or appear to be unused and can be safely removed:
    *   `modules/cloudflare_solver.py`
    *   `modules/new.py`

3.  **Complex and Overloaded Modules:** Several modules have a large number of responsibilities, making them difficult to maintain and understand. For example:
    *   `main.py`: Handles argument parsing, file loading, and orchestrates the entire application flow.
    *   `email_verification.py`: Manages everything from entering email addresses in the browser to intercepting network requests.
    *   `text_recording_handler.py`: Handles campaign selection, audio generation, file uploads, and API interactions.

4.  **Inconsistent Naming and Structure:** There are inconsistencies in naming conventions and the overall structure of the project. For example, some modules use `snake_case` while others use `PascalCase` for class names.

5.  **Hardcoded Configuration:** Many configuration values are hardcoded directly in the source code, making it difficult to change them without modifying the code.

### Proposed Refactoring Plan:

1.  **Centralize Logging:** Remove the custom logging setup from `main.py` and use the logger from `modules/logger.py` throughout the application.

2.  **Remove Unused Files:** Delete `modules/cloudflare_solver.py` and `modules/new.py`.

3.  **Restructure Modules:**
    *   Create a new `core` directory for fundamental components like `config.py`, `database.py`, and `logger.py`.
    *   Create a `utils` directory for helper modules like `browser.py` and `file_utils.py`.
    *   Create a `features` directory for high-level application features like `registration.py` and `campaigns.py`.

4.  **Refactor `main.py`:** Simplify `main.py` to only handle command-line argument parsing and to delegate tasks to other modules.

5.  **Standardize Naming:** Enforce consistent naming conventions (e.g., `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for classes).




### Detailed Refactoring Steps and Module Responsibilities:

#### 1. Centralize Logging
*   **Action:** Remove the custom logging setup from `main.py` (lines 14-70). This includes the `logger` initialization, `CustomFormatter` class, and `log_info`, `log_success`, `log_warning`, `log_error` functions.
*   **Action:** In `main.py`, replace calls to `log_info`, `log_success`, `log_warning`, `log_error` with calls to the `logger` object imported from `modules.logger`. For example, `log_info("message")` becomes `logger.info("message")`.
*   **Responsibility:** The `modules/logger.py` module will be the single source of truth for all logging configurations and functions. It will handle formatting, console output, and file logging.

#### 2. Remove Unused Files
*   **Action:** Delete `modules/cloudflare_solver.py` and `modules/new.py` from the repository. These files are empty or contain no relevant code.

#### 3. Restructure Modules
*   **New Directory Structure:**
    ```
    psdn/
    ├── core/
    │   ├── config.py
    │   ├── database.py
    │   └── logger.py
    ├── utils/
    │   ├── browser_utils.py
    │   ├── email_manager.py
    │   ├── proxy_manager.py
    │   ├── token_manager.py
    │   └── natural_speech_enhancer.py
    ├── features/

    │   ├── ui_interactions.py
    │   ├── voice_handler.py
    │   └── voice_models.py
    └── main.py
    ```
*   **Action:** Create `core`, `utils`, and `features` directories.
*   **Action:** Move files to their respective new directories as outlined above.
*   **Action:** Update all import statements in the code to reflect the new file paths (e.g., `from logger import get_logger` might become `from core.logger import get_logger`).

#### 4. Refactor `main.py`
*   **Action:** Simplify `main.py` to primarily handle the main execution flow, user interaction for menu choices, and delegation to other modules. Remove direct logging setup and file loading logic.
*   **Responsibility:** `main.py` will act as the orchestrator, coordinating calls to the `Database` and `PoseidonClient` classes.

#### 5. Standardize Naming
*   **Action:** Review all files and ensure consistent use of `snake_case` for function and variable names, and `PascalCase` for class names.

#### 6. Reduce Log Verbosity
*   **Action:** Review `main.py` and other modules for excessive logging. Prioritize `INFO` and `SUCCESS` for key operations, `WARNING` for non-critical issues, and `ERROR` for failures. Remove redundant or overly verbose `INFO` logs, especially those that repeat information already clear from the context.

#### 7. Address Hardcoded Configuration
*   **Action:** Ensure all configurable parameters are defined in `config.py` and accessed through `config.PARAMETER_NAME`. Move any hardcoded values found in other modules to `config.py`.

#### Module Responsibilities (Detailed):

*   **`core/config.py`**: Centralized configuration for the entire application. All global settings, file paths, delays, API keys, etc., should reside here.
*   **`core/database.py`**: Handles all interactions with the `database.json` file, including loading, saving, and managing account data and proxies. It should be responsible for data integrity and consistency.
*   **`core/logger.py`**: Provides a robust and centralized logging mechanism for the entire application. It should handle log formatting, output to console and file, and different log levels.

*   **`utils/browser_utils.py`**: Contains utility functions and classes for browser automation, such as setting up the browser, navigating to URLs, and handling common browser interactions (e.g., `wait_for_element_and_click`).
*   **`utils/email_manager.py`**: Manages email interactions, specifically for fetching verification codes from email inboxes.
*   **`utils/proxy_manager.py`**: Manages proxy lists, including loading, validating, and marking bad proxies. It should provide methods for proxy rotation and selection.
*   **`utils/token_manager.py`**: Handles the retrieval and management of authentication tokens within the browser session.
*   **`utils/natural_speech_enhancer.py`**: Provides functionality to enhance the naturalness of generated speech, such as adding pauses and breathing sounds.

*   **`features/auth_handler.py`**: Encapsulates the entire authentication and registration flow, including UI interactions, email verification, and handling Turnstile challenges.
*   **`features/campaign_manager.py`**: Manages the selection and assignment of campaigns to accounts.
*   **`features/campaigns.py`**: Defines the available campaigns and provides helper functions for campaign-related data.
*   **`features/email_verification.py`**: Specifically handles the email verification steps during registration, including entering email and retrieving verification codes.
*   **`features/microphone_handler.py`**: Manages microphone permissions and interactions within the browser environment.
*   **`features/registration_flow.py`**: Orchestrates the steps involved in the user registration process, including handling intro steps and voice profile creation.
*   **`features/text_recording_handler.py`**: Manages the text recording campaign, including generating audio, uploading files, and interacting with the API for script assignments.
*   **`features/ui_interactions.py`**: Provides a set of functions for common UI interactions like clicking buttons, closing modals, and accepting terms.
*   **`features/voice_handler.py`**: Handles voice-related operations, likely interacting with the `audio_generator` and `microphone_handler`.
*   **`features/voice_models.py`**: Defines and manages voice models used for audio generation (e.g., Eleven Labs voices).
